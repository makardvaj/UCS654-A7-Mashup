## 🌟 Key Features

| :--- | :--- |

| **☁️ Cloud-Ready** | Optimized for Streamlit Cloud with Cookie Authentication to bypass YouTube blocks. |

## 🚀 How It Works

![Workflow Diagram](image/mashup_workflow.png)

1.  **Input**: You provide a Singer Name and Number of Tracks.
2.  **Scrape**: The engine hunts down high-quality audio from YouTube (avoiding live/video versions).
3.  **Process**:
    *   **Normalization**: Levels volume across tracks.
    *   **Smart Cut**: Extracts the 30s high-energy segment.
    *   **Crossfade**: Blends tracks with a 1.5s professional fade.
4.  **Delivery**: The final mix is compressed, zipped, and emailed.
